            <p class="frase">Hello, my name is <b>Aquiles Norese</b> and I am a certified translator of english and
                spanish
                who graduated
                from the IESNÂº28 eight years ago. I am a native spanish speaker born in argentina and with this
                website
                I plan to expand my possibilities in terms of work I can do for clients on the internet.

                I finished my studies at a high school in Rosario where I realized that I loved English. Then I
                began to internalize much more with this new language. It was a love that only grew. I decided to
                start studying the career of "translator" in which I received honors for good grades. They quickly
                hired me to translate texts and very little later comics. After 7 years of those types of work, I
                realized that I was tired and that's when, in 2020, I opened my own website to be able to help
                people in another way.
                So this is me, a trained, dedicated, organized and responsible person. I have no doubt that every
                day you learn something new in this type of work, but I am very happy to be able to help you achieve
                things. I hope this page helps you, any questions ask me. Good luck!
            </p>
